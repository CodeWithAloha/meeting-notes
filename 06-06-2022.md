Zoning Tutorial 

*A place for everything, and everything in it’s place - Trey*

TLDR: In every place, there are rules regulating what you can put there, how big it can be, and what you can do with it

- Districts
    - Zoning Map ([https://www.honolulugis.org/](https://www.honolulugis.org/))
    - Land Use Ordinance ([https://www.honolulu.gov/ocs/roh/193-site-ocs-cat/975-roh-chapter-21.html](https://www.honolulu.gov/ocs/roh/193-site-ocs-cat/975-roh-chapter-21.html))
        - What are these? Laws typically regulating density (Population) or bulk (Size & Shape of buildings)
        - How often are these updated?
            - Last time updated in full - 1986
            - Revision is in progress, started in 2017
