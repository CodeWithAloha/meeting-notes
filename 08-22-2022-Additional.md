# Code For Hawaii Host Meeting Notes 8/22/2022

## Action Items:

- Schedule a meeting with Ben to go over host notes
- Prioritize the current list of improvements
- Schedule a regular time for hosts to meet

## Feedback on meetings:

- Have the project leads announce the types of roles that are available for newcomers for their project. The new members can self-sort from there.
    - Example: Start including what roles are needed in the HZA.

## Feedback on host’s responsibility:

- Make sure no one gets left behind
- Help get new people to projects.
    - The faster they are included in projects the happier they’ll be
- Help people with the barrier to entry by having a section that recommends people have a basic set of technology skills. It’s the responsibility of the project leads to help get people up to speed for their project. (For example, we use zoom for our weekly meetings, slack for communication)

## Feedback on working with people with projects:

- Create a process for vetting potential clients
    - Determine their level of commitment
    - Determine if they have a proposed timeline
    - Determine what resources they have
    - Give expectations such as attending at least 2 meetings a month
    - Give approximate end date
    - Schedule a meeting with someone to talk over requirements
    - Know what skill sets you’ll need
- Create a form for potential clients to fill out that answers some of the questions above
    - Add this form as a section to the website
- More work on vetting the potential clients. How committed are they, what resources do they have?

## Additional Ideas and notes

- Having more projects would help retention
- Have more leadership meetings
    - This could be a dedicated date and time.
        - 4th Monday of the month
        - 30 minutes or an hour before the CFH meeting.
- Increase CFH outreach
    - Create an outreach group that focuses on bringing in new members
        - The outreach group can attend code events or hackathons
        - Come up with a plan for how we’ll sign people up
    - Increase social media presence
        - We currently have no social media presence
            - Brianda Hernandez works as part of marketing for Code for Sacramento, looking to coordinate with someone to help with outreach
            - Jez may be interested in marketing
            - Get projects to showcase for social media
    - Add a section to the website to give an onboarding flow
        - Interested in getting involved?
            - Join us here:  Meetup link
            - Communicate with us here: slack link
            - Possible survey
    - It’s important to not wait too long for the perfect infrastructure to be in place because that’s wasted time that could be spent getting new members and working on projects.
- Keep track of quotes used for the land acknowledgment
    - Keep in GitHub?
- Have a survey that people can optionally fill out either about the hosts or the onboarding process to get more data for why someone may not join again.
- Create a new slack channel
    - Since there isn’t a reason for us to be a part of HiCapacity
    - Come up with a migration process
        - Slack bot that reminds people that the slack channel is being migrated
- Create a new website
    - The old website isn’t capable of handling the dynamic content necessary to add new members or engage with potential clients
