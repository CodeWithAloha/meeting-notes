# 11/27/2022 CFH Reboot meeting

## Budget

There is currently no source of revenue
Ben is fighting to get our money from CFA finance who says we have nothing. We should have around $1000 in discretionary funding. 

We have legacy costs for AWS which Suschandra pays out of pocket. s3 bucket and VMs. $5 - 10 /month for various projects we've done in the past. 


## Partners/Fundraising

CFH has done hackathons which we could use to find partners, 
Make an email asking partners for donations
Meetup also has way of asking for donations

Luckily, we don't need a lot of money for things.

Using the fundraising campaign as a way to break the ice with potential partners

"Code For America does this fundraising, please consider donating to our local chapter."

Reaching out to places to reduce costs as well.

As part of the fundraising strategy we should have a project portfolio that shows CFH's impact

### Creating an impact portfolio

HZA: Towards the end of the R and D portion. Validating the zoning data. Looking at partnership for UX High. Moving into showing it off in affordable housing communities, services, elected officials and gathering feedback on how they'd like to use that moving forward.

Showcasing what the volunteers did for the HZA. Piggyback on CFA's impact's numbers.  

### Showing funds

What will we use this money for? Getting a budget for the quartly meetings. Optional meeting per month with pizza? 

Have someone put together a budget and if it's greater than the expenses then fundraising should be more of a priority. 

Relationship building from asking for things is important/core of the strategy. 

Accountability is important. Best practices to say where their funds are going. The type of field trips are important. Working with indeginious hawaiians/improving relationships through understanding.

Important that we're upfront in the ask. If the community doesn't want us to do it, also an important signal

## Leadership Hierarchy
Having a role that does the following:
* Volunteer outreach
* Volunteer onboarding
  * Ideally having one person responsible for each of those things. 

Have goals we want to accomplish in 2023, how much do we want to grow in terms of active members?
Track down bootcamps, UH, etc. 


## Project Intake
- Get projects
- Vet Projects
- Complete projects
Project Maintenance: we should have a point where we hand the project back to the partner so we do not have to deal with maintenance

## Admin Notes

Get clues on why people are leaving. Use collected emails for why people stopped showing. In two or three sentences, why didn't you come back?

The group should only do things that are fun. If there's a role that doesn't seem fun, there is probably a person that enjoys it. The group should try to recruit. 

## Project Notes

Documenting old projects. What brought  the project, what went wrong/right. Used to help mitigate the potential issues with projects. 

We should come up with some standard operating procedures. Having an onboarding process. What is our project intake process? Timeline, two points of contact.


## Admin Goals
* What are the existing project statuses
* Community goals
* Assessment of what resources we have and how they match with goals
